# vk-voxel-raytracer

Attempt to write a Voxel Raytracer using Vulkan

## Code Style

I want to abstract away as many details as possible, including the Vulkan interface,
allocations etc.

This is possible using an Entity Component System.


## First Goals/Steps

- [ ] Entity Component System Base
- [ ] GLFW + Vulkan integration
- [ ] Vulkan Window

These steps are my primary focus for now, more will be added in the future.
